        <h2>How Animation Relates to STEM</h2>
        Modern animation is typically computer-generated, meaning it uses a lot of technology and computer science. Animators need knowledge of computer graphics, programming, and digital modeling. They also require a basic understanding of physics and mathematics to help movement feel more fluid. In occasional cases, data analytics and algorithms are used for efficiency and realism.
        <h2>Interview with Abby Fitzgerald</h2>
        Abby Fitzgerald is an animator at a studio called Icon Creative based in Canada. Icon Creative works on kids’ shows such as Monsters at Work and Disney Junior’s Ariel. She’s been in the industry for around 2 years but already has an impressive career, having been hired about a month after she finished college. One of her projects is her thesis film Soothsayin’ Saloon which she has shown at film festivals! <br><br>
        Abby defines animation as an artistic study of movement and acting, or acting by proxy. She uses Autodesk Maya for her animation and describes some tools that help her out. She says that most animation tools in Autodesk Maya such as saved libraries and Playblast are time savers. A software called Nuke takes 3D animation and integrates 2D effects.<br><br>

        <div class="quote">“There’s something that is missed when you do CG that is just this level of impressiveness, almost, because everything is drawn…Drawing something consistently that often is a very difficult skill, and it requires you not only to be good with technical things, but a good artist” (Fitzgerald).

        <h2>2D Animation</h2>
        There are three steps to 2D animation: preproduction, production, and post-production. Preproduction entails sketching, brainstorming designs, and creating storyboards (comic strip-like illustrations of events). Production is when the animation actually happens, and post-production takes the animation from production to clean up lines, smooth out the animation, finish backgrounds, and add color.
        <h2>3D Animation</h2>
        3D animation is a three-part process. It includes modeling, layout and animation, and rendering. Modeling is the creation of 3D objects: “This kind of animation is achieved by using a modeling tool. A 3D mesh is made from a simple object, called a primitive, which is then shaped and refined to the desired figure” (Upwork). After color and texture are applied to the figure, the object goes through rigging that the animators will then use to move characters in a natural way.<br><br>
        The second step to 3D animation is layout and animation. The animation itself can be done in many different ways such as keyframes, frame-by-frame, and motion capture data.<br><br>
        The third step of 3D animation is rendering. This happens afer lighting and camera angles are set. According to Upwork,  “In this process, the graphic images that have been designed are actually created and exported. The final render of the 3D character will be tweaked according to light and shadows, reflections, transparency, and other details”.
        <h2>Differentiating Between the Two</h2>
        Unlike 2D animation, “all elements have some sort of volume or mass” (Au 21) in 3D animation. The lighting is also completed differently; for 2D animation, it is done however the artist chooses to depict it, whereas the software that produces the models for 3D animation automatically determines the lighting. 2D animation also allows for complete freedom of choice over medium (such as watercolor, charcoal, and colored pencils) whereas 3D animation is limited to the program in which it is produced.<br><br>
        Hybrid animation is when 3D and 2D animation are combined. Oftentimes, 3D models are put in front of 2D backgrounds.
        <h2>Why Hybrid?</h2>
        Hybrid animation combines the positive aspects of 2D and 3D animation and is usually used in instances where it will save money rather than for artistic or aesthetic purposes. Another reason studios choose hybrid animation is “to see [2D and 3D media] as two parts of a broader picture that can coexist and naturally interact with each other, despite it being impossible in the real world” (Mlynarčíková 44).
        <h2>Examples of Hybrid Animation</h2>
        <h3>Spiderverse</h3>
        Sony animators had to completely rethink their ideas of animation to create Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. Sony created new technology for the film including software that could predict where they wanted to place expressive lines on top of the 3D models. Spiderverse is a completely new idea of how hybrid animation can be applied to evoke emotion and opens the doors for so much more creativity in animated films!
        <h3>Klaus</h3>
        The animators for Klaus also created new technology for the film! They created KLaS which allowed for computer-generated lighting for a mostly 2D movie. Computers used AI to determine where light should hit, and artists fine-tuned the inaccuracies. Objects that aren’t necessarily “natural” were sometimes 3D to allow for ease of animation.
