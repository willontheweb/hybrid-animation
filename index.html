        <h2>How Animation Relates to STEM</h2>
        Modern animation is typically computer generated, meaning a lot of technology and computer science, animators need knowledge of computer graphics, programming, and digital modeling. Animators also require a basic understanding of physics and mathematics to help movement  feel more fluid. In occasional cases data analytics and algorithms are used for efficiency and realism.
        <h2>Interview with Abby Fitzgerald</h2>
        Abby Fitzgerald is an animator at a studio called Icon Creative based in Canada. Icon Creative works on kids’ shows such as Monsters at Work and Disney Junior’s Ariel. She’s been in the industry for around 2 years but already has an impressive career, having been hired about a month after she finished college. One of her own projects is her thesis film which she showed at film festivals.
        In a general sense, animation is an artistic study of movement and acting—acting by a proxy. Most animation tools in Autodesk Maya such as saved libraries and Playblast are time savers. The level of impressiveness from 2D is missed in 3D, it takes so much more effort but it is difficult and impressive. Software called Nuke takes 3D animation and integrates 2D effects.
        <h2>Animation (2D)</h2>
        Three parts
        Preproduction: sketching, brainstorming designs, creating storyboards (A graphic comic strip-like illustration of events)
        Production: where the animation actually takes place 
        Post-production: clean up lines, smooth out animation, finish background of the scene, add color to make the final product stand out
        <h2>Animation (3D)</h2>
        What does the process entail?
        Modeling
        The creation of 3d objects.
        “This kind of animation is achieved by using a modeling tool. A 3D mesh is made from a simple object, called a primitive, which is then shaped and refined to the desired figure.” 
        Color and texture are applied to the figure.
        The object then goes through “rigging”--a sort of “skeleton” that animators will use to move a character in a natural way.
        Layout & Animation
        Animation itself can be done in many different ways (find more info on this in specific!). Examples:
        Keyframes
        Frame-by-frame
        Motion capture data
        Rendering
        Occurs after lighting and camera angles are set
        “In this process, the graphic images that have been designed are actually created and exported. The final render of the 3D character will be tweaked according to light and shadows, reflections, transparency, and other details.
        <h2>Differentiating Between the Two</h2>
        In 3D animation, “all elements have some sort of volume or mass” (Au 21).
        Lighting
        2D: lighting is determined by how the artist chooses to depict it
        3D: the software that produces the models automatically determines the lighting
        Media limitations
        2D animation allows for complete freedom of choice over medium (i.e. watercolor, charcoal, colored pencil, etc.) 
        3D computer animation is limited to the program in which it is produced
        <h2>Hybrid Animation</h2>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        The 2D background is drawn separately from the 3D model and the two are put together in a different program
        Animating in twos/ones
        In 2D animation, animators will animate in twos (using the same frame twice) to save time
        3D animation uses graphs rather than frames; therefore, it is easier to lead with 3D when animating in twos rather than trying to match graphs to frames.
        <h2>Why Hybrid?</h2>
        <h3>Natural flow</h3>
        “Instead of seeing 2D and 3D media as separate entities, some projects invite us to see them as two parts of a broader picture that can coexist and naturally interact with each other, despite it being impossible in the real world” (Mlynarčíková 44).
        <h3>Money-saver</h3>Money-saver
        Hybrid animation combines the positive aspects of 2D and 3D animation and is usually used in instances where it will save money—rather than for artistic or aesthetic purposes
        <h2>Examples of Hybrid Animation</h2>
        <h3>Into the Spiderverse</h3>
        Sony animators had to completely rethink their ideas of animation to create Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse.
        Sony created new technology for the film including software that could predict where they wanted to place expressive lines on top of the 3D models.
        Spiderverse is a completely new idea of how hybrid animation can be applied to evoke emotion and opens the doors for so much creativity
        <h3>The Mitchells vs. the Machines</h3>
        Sony uses techniques developed in the making of Spiderverse to add a unique flair to Katie’s doodles.
        2D drawings are layered over the 3D animation to show the inner workings of Katie’s brain
        <h3>Klaus</h3>
        The animators for Klaus also created new technology for the film! They created KLaS which allowed for computer-generated lighting for a mostly 2D movie
        The computer used AI to determine where light should hit, and artists fine-tuned the inaccuracies
        Objects that aren’t necessarily “natural” were sometimes 3D to allow for ease of animation
